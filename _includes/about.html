    <h3> My Expertise </h3>
    <p> {{site.user_description}}
    •	As this is an ever evolving field, I am also continuously learning new things. For example, at the moment I am part of one of the first cohorts of the Udacity Self Driving Car Nanodegree, where I am learning about advanced topics like machine learning, sensor fusion, and path planning.
    •	Before joining JLR as part of their graduate scheme, I did my MSc at University of Manchester on Advanced Control and Systems Engineering. Before this, I started my BSc in Industrial Electronics and Automation Engineering at UC3M in Spain to later move to the USA and finish it at UCLA.
    •	During my university years I co-founded Printie, a 3D printing marketplace where anyone could upload and sell/buy quality 3D printable designs </p>

      <p>Sensors are the eyes and ears of the self driving cars. We will need a full 360 degree coverage with each one of the main sensor technologies.
        Sensor fusion becomes more important than ever and an essential part to achieve autonomous driving.
